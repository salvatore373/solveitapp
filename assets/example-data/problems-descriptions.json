The reasons are simple: a floating plastic bag can look like a lot of jellyfish, algae, or other species that make up a large component of the sea turtles’ diets.\n\nAll sea turtle species are at risk from plastic.\n\nMore at: https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-do-sea-turtles-eat-unfortunately-plastic-bags",
    "e976b6cb-e5b0-4abd-ad86-31b7d1affe3a": "Air pollution is a significant global threat to human health. Each year, air pollution is responsible for 5 million deaths: 91% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and 97% of cities in these countries do not meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines.\n\nThere are numerous factors that contribute to air pollution. The tourism industry, for example, has a substantial impact. In a typical year billions of people travel internationally, often putting pressure on local environments and communities, contributing to global emissions. In fact, transportation accounts for 90% of the tourism industry’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Low-resource island nations are particularly vulnerable to the negative environmental effects of tourism, as travellers increase the demand for already-limited natural resources.\n\nMore at: https://www.iamat.org/blog/air-pollution-and-travel-how-to-stay-safe-and-reduce-your-impact/",
